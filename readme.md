This application uses the 'My Sports Feed' API to retrieve data on professional basketball players.
The user can do research on players and then decide who they want on their team. Add a player to your team by clicking
the add button next to the player's search results. Using hardcoded statistics for a fake season, your team will earn points
based on how many points each player scored in their respective games.

In depth analysis to come as the project develops further.
